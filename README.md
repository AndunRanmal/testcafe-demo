# Testcafe - Nodejs Test Automation Framework

## What is Testcafe

Testcafe is a nodeJs tool to automate end to end web testing and execute tests in many popular platforms for both desktop and mobile. To setup testcafe framework you would only take less than 1 minute, only one `npm` command without any kind of webdriver.

This is an open source tool free to use under MIT license. There is a active community to answer your questions and hundreds of plugins developed by the community to integrate with other tools or to generate custom reports.

## How Testcafe works

Most of the legacy automation tools were relied on webdriver, which emulate the user actions outside the browser. This approach had some drawbacks which limits the test automation engineers' capabilities and complexity in building up a automation framework. Some of these are 

* Dependency on third party tools
* Limited browser support
* Boilerplate code
* Low automation
